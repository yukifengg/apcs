HW98 -- structuring an APQ
2022-05-13
time spent: 0.5h


Notes on API consultation:
    - why no size for PriorityQueue?
    - why are we only working with smaller values? for context,
      the API shows that there is a peak<in and removeMin method,
      however there is none for max. 
    - avalible methods: add(object x), isEmpty(), peekMin(), removeMin()

Design:
    - Dequeue for priority -> searching for val makes more sense vs 
      having all the values and add them one at a time 
    - Enqueue from the left
    - Value represents priority -> if we enqueue 1 then 18, 18 would 
      have a greater priority since its value is larget 
    - To take out an element with priority status just remove it first
        - deque == remove?

Priorities list:
    - add(object x)
    - removeMin()
    - peekMin()
    - isEmpty()
