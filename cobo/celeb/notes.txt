DISCO:
- For mac users, you may get an error when trying to run CelebrityRunner:
	Warning: the fonts "Times" and "Times" are not available for the Java logical font "Serif", which may have unexpected appearance or behavior. Re-enable the "Times" font to remove this warning.
Due to some research, we discovered that the OSx Montery update does not have the Times font installed for some reason, so we simply installed Times into our mac machines from https://www.freebestfonts.com/timr45w-font. That got rid of the font error.
