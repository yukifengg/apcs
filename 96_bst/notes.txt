DISCO:
* Search can be done with a while loop instead of recursion
* In traversals, it's important to account for the null case

QCC:
* Comment: we should make a checklist of things to checklist
  when the code isn't working so we don't spend 30 minutes 
  panicking about not working code when all we did was not 
  print the return statement...not speaking from experience 
  at all, no siree. 
* Are all of our tree functions going to be recursive? Or at 
  least it suggested that we do them with recusion?
* Why don't search and the other methods work with a null root? 
  How do we past this?
