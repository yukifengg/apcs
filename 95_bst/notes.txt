With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦

1) a perfect binary tree has 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 ...2^n nodes

2) at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^L nodes

3) height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is the number of digits when 
   you convert n into binary (7 -> 111 -> h = 3 or 15 -> 1111 -> h = 4)


DISCO:
* You can get away with no privacy (even though vscode was yelling at us 
  for a while)

QCC:
* When we didn't use println in the pre order traveral method, it 
  didn't print out...but when we used println it worked...why??
* When do you need to import a java file inorder to use it? We think 
  it's when the file is not in the same folder you're trying to access 
  it from.
