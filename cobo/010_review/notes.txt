LAB ANSWERS:

- ACTIVITY 1 -
1.
  a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
  b) Yes, a String, you get error if diff param passed.
  c) return double
2.
  method call || return value
  sentimentVal("nice"); || 2.09
  sentimentVal("rude"); || -0.42
  sentimentVal("great"); || 1.48
3.
  a) yes because sentimentVal intakes String "warm" and returns double that will
  then be used as value for num
  b) no bc sentimentVal only returns doubles
  c) no bc sentimentVal only takes 1 param

- ACTIVITY 2 -
4.
  it works by iterating through the String with a for loop and checking if the
  adjective has sentimental value. we add up the sentimental values we find.
5.
  a) the star ratings make sense bc more sentiment means a better review which
  the stars account for. SimpleReview is a negative review w low totalSentiment
  so it returns 1 star whereas OrangeReview is positive w high totalSentiment so
  it returns more stars.
  b) compare the pos adj to words near it to see if it is actually correct
  sentiment and compare amt pos to neg to see if review was majority neg or pos
6.
 a) did not account for totalSentiment values >= 15 bc it does not make sense to
 have more sentiment yet lower stars
 b) have an else if statement testing for (totalSentiment >=15) which will return
 5 stars and then else will return 0 stars.

- ACTIVITY 3 -
3.
  indexOf finds the index of a character you specify and then substring cuts a
  String from that index i until the end of the String or a specified index after
  i. It is necessary to add 1 bc String indices start at 0.
5.
  static cannot be overriden like non static methods and it belongs to the class,
  not an object in the class.
6.
  instead of randomAdjective, use randomNegativeAdj or randomPositiveAdj
