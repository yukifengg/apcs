DISCO
- you have to specify the javac command with -classpath in order to compile foreign files like jar...? (not sure if this is correct)

QCC
- why do we need jar files? what are they good for?

YAK's CSV FLOW:
<insert your description of your tools and workflow in creating, editing CSV files>
- Kaggle did not load on safari, so firefox had to be used to see the data.

TRUBZ
- sinbad.jar introduced a lot of troubles in compiling. Yuki suffered from the temptations of sleep when having to type out the path to compiling and running it.
