DISCO
------------------------------------------------
* Each turtle follows the same set of instructions. â†“
* There are some recursive steps involved in the process.
* It's similar to the termites simulation:
  * termites start by creating smaller piles and combine these piles into a larger one
  * we make smaller sorted lists and combine them gradually with each pass back
================================================


QCC
------------------------------------------------
* Why couldn't you look at your deck of cards in class? How do you merge decks without looking?
* How efficient is this algorithm?
================================================


THINKER FIRMWARE
------------------------------------------------
* When you recieve a deck, check if there is only one card.
   * If there is only one card, hand the card back to the giver.
   * Else, split the deck in half and give them each to two new turtles.
* When you recieve two decks, perform the merging algorithm for sorted lists.
  Once you are done, hand the merged deck to your original/first giver.
