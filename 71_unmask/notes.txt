- for any n element array, you must need (n-1)/2 of the array to have vals less than the median and the other half with vals more
- everything less than arr[c] to the left of it
- everything greater than arr[c] to its right
- O(n-1) bc u only loop thru n-1 elements bc u choose c to be the middle element
