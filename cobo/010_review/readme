This lab felt long because of the amount of reading that had to be done. Besides that, there were many questions to be answered. It was nice to have all the essential helper methods be made for us already, as it made the process of creating methods such as fakeReview and fakeReview 2 easy. The last activity was fun since it let us make any method we wanted as long as it met the requirements.
