# TEAM YAK
Yuki Feng, Anjini Katari, Kevin Li

### Our experience
 - We struggled the first night a lot with getting a jar file to run in the JRE
 environment, but then we finally figured it out after consulting Piazza. We were
 able to get up to activity 3.
 - Wednesday, the day it was due, we went to the dojo to complete the rest of it.
 The dojo was packed, but Yuki was able to find a seat and work on taking down
 notes and finishing her portion of activity 3 because YAK wanted to avoid git merge
 errors and also wanted to conquer and divide.
