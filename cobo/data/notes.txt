DISCO
- you have to specify the javac command with -classpath in order to direct foreign files like jar
- encapsulation idea clicked for yukester when handling the Weatherstation and its methods from Welcome_03_List.java

QCC
- why do we need jar files? what are they good for?
- when a xml file appears to have an array inside a column, should it be treated like a 2d array?
- why are we unable to load csv files into the JRE? It was a common pitfall for most of the dojo bretheren.


YAK's CSV FLOW:
<insert your description of your tools and workflow in creating, editing CSV files>
- Kaggle did not load on safari, so firefox had to be used to see the data.
- we did not use csv files and instead turned to xml files found on a data.nasa.gov instead of kaggle

TRUBZ
- sinbad.jar introduced a lot of troubles in compiling. Yuki suffered from the temptations of sleep when having to type out the path to compiling and running it.
- we could not connect and load csv files into the JRE
