HW97 -- Prune Your Tree
2022-05-12
time spent: 2.5h

DISCO:
* search() is a very helpful function to direct the remove method to the node of
which you should start checking their subtrees

QCC:
* why cant we just setValue(null) to null that sucks we just wanna delete the
child itself, instead of having parent kill it.
* we were stuck on removing leaves, even though it is a base case...
