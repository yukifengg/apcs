## LAB07: ELEVENS!!
## APCS PD08
## 2021-03-20
## time spent: 3.0 hrs

# Summary:
* Lab 07 provided our trio with insight on how to implement different shuffle methods and apply it to a 52 card deck.
* However, the lab was also time consuming and gave our trio a number of challenges, some of which hindered our efficiency.
* We tried our best as a trio to split up the work (ex: coding, notes, flag) to divide and conquer this lab.
* We communicated through a Zoom call and made sure to contribute all of our own discoveries and insights with each other.
* Overall, the implementation was both straightforward and challenging at times and we gave the lab our best efforts.
