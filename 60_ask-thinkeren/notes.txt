- Thinkers are like turtles and do only what they r told to do and do not think for themselves
- If you have 2 decks, return them to the og deck owners
- If you have 2 cards, give those away
- Never sort yourself, keep on giving it away
- Actually thinking would mean O(n^2) computational sorting and we want to avoid that
- If hands full with one card, do not take card from another thinker
